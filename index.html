                                    You need to have faith, and only when you hold on to it that even the ‘impossible’ turns out to be ‘possible.’ It is important to understand that all things are possible for the one who believes! You need to work ahead with a belief that no matter how many hurdles come along your way, things aren’t going to turn impossible.

I was working on one project in my previous organization. My post is the branch manager and I have to handle a ten manager under me. That time I hassled them to get work done. Most of the time the work gets done but when I realize that times the work is not in a proper way. The day was come to submit the project to the client but my team didn’t complete it on time.</p>
